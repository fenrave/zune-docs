# Info Command
---

The `info` command is used to display the built runtime.

On linux the runtime would dynamically pick `io_uring` or `epoll` for async backend.

This has an optional `all` parameter to get more details on the libraries zune shipped.

### Usage

```bash
zune info [all]
zune -V [all]
zune --version [all]
```

### Example
```
zune info
```

```
version:  0.5.0
luau:     0.693
async:    io_uring
platform: x86_64-linux-gnu
threaded: true (2 threads)
build:    ReleaseFast
```
