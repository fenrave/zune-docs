  ```

## Flags

### Profiler
A run flag that profiles the script and outputs a performance report.

The file can be found as `profile.out` in the current working directory.

Use this [`perfgraph.py`](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/blob/master/tools/perfgraph.py) python script by [Luau](https://luau.org/) to visualize the profile.

Profile with default frequency (~10000).
```bash
zune run --profile ...
```
Profile with a custom frequency.
```bash
zune run --profile=100000 ...
```

### Optimization Level
```bash
zune run -O=0|1|2 ...
```

### Debug Level
```bash
zune run -g=0|1|2 ...
```

### Native
Enables native code generation by default. This is the default behavior.
```bash
zune run --native ...
```

### No-native
Stops zune from using native code generation by default.
This does not remove the native code generation, checkout [no-jit flag](#no-jit).
```bash
zune test --no-native ...
```

### No-jit

```bash
zune test --no-jit ...
```

### Limbo
Disables all of zune libraries.
```bash

```
