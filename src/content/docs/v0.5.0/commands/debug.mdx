The `debug` command is used to run a script in the current environment with debugging capabilities.

This would load an interactive debugger at the start of the command, allowing to setup your debugging environment.

Compile default for debug level would be set to level `2`, and native codegen will be disabled.

### Usage

```bash
zune debug [script]
```

## Flags

### Optimization Level
```bash
zune debug -O=0|1|2 ...
```

### Once
Enables the `--once` flag, which runs the debugger once, will not restart scripts.
```bash
zune debug --once ...
```

### Limbo
Disables all of zune libraries.
```bash
zune debug --limbo ...
```

### No-fmt
Disables print formatting
```bash
zune debug --no-fmt ...
```

### Ipc-port
The client debugger would attempt to connect to `127.0.0.1:<port>` as a TCP Client with the provided `<port>` parameter after `--ipc-port=`, in this mode, the signals and controls have special message encoding.
```bash
zune debug --ipc-port=3000
```
